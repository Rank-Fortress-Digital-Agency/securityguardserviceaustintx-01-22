                    How to choose a private investigator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When hiring a private investigator, it is important to choose someone who is qualified and trustworthy. The best way to find a qualified investigator is to ask friends, family, or colleagues for referrals. It is also important to check the investigator’s licensing and insurance status. Be sure to ask about the investigator’s experience in the type of case you need help with and get an estimate of the cost before hiring anyone. When speaking with a potential investigator, be candid about your reasons for hiring him or her and share as much information about the case as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many private investigators offer a free initial consultation to prospective clients, so you may want to ask for this before signing a contract. A reputable private investigator will not pressure you to hire him or her after the initial consultation or sign a long-term contract. Be sure to get all of the relevant contact information in writing, including the investigator’s business name and address, phone number, e-mail address, and fax number.
